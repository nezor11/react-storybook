# Welcome to Custom Resume Storybook made by <em>nezor</em>

This configuration file sets up a React Storybook environment, providing a visually interactive showcase for different React components. It incorporates various features and settings to enhance the user experience and demonstrate the versatility of React development.

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

Browse example stories now by navigating to them in the sidebar.
View their code in the `stories` directory to learn how they work.
We recommend building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.

## Viewports

Custom viewports have been defined to facilitate responsive testing, covering a range of devices from Full HD televisions to various laptops and mobile devices.
